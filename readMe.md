# CLASSIFIES DIABETES ON REST API

## Overview

The development of a REST API for classifying diabetes patients based on input features is a critical step in modern healthcare analytics and patient management. This API allows healthcare professionals, researchers, and developers to harness the power of machine learning and data analysis to make informed decisions regarding diabetes diagnosis and treatment.

## Information Of Model
I couldn't perform the data preprocessing steps I know on this data because there were no 'NaN' values in the dataset. The things I knew to be correct in the feature engineering section didn't work for this dataset, and as a result, I have a poor accuracy score. I learned about random search in this project, and it seems like there's still a lot more for me to learn.

## How To Use 
Run app.py and go to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/default/predictDiabetes_predict_post" section to see the sample data or schema. To make a prediction, go to the 'Try it out' section and enter the desired data. Then, click the execute button. The prediction result will appear below.
